 # What is Linux
 
-  Linux is a kernel

## WHAT is kernel?

- Kernel is a code/program that used to meet your Software and Hardware. And allocate some resources.
 

## History of Linux

- In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer, 
- which was chosen mainly because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it

- BUT IT WASN’T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE

- Then Person called “LINUS TORVALDS” Created the Linux kernel. And posted it online to make it open-source.


- Richard Stallman announced the GNU project in 1983 and cofounded the Free Software Foundation in 1985.

- GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS, But it was just software replacement not full os {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .

- So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.

- The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed

## What is Shell?

- Users communicate with the kernel by the shell.

- The Shell is a Command Line Interpreter. It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel.


## Types of shells
- Based on their features there are money shells.
- SH
- BASH
- ZSH
- FISH

> They differ in Colouring,Piping,command compilation, some kind of features.

- TO IDENTIFY YOUR SHELL “echo $SHELL”

## What is OS- Operating system?
- We have said UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS but what is OS. OS is “operating system”, which means the main software part of computer that helps to work on.
- It contains:
- Kernel
- Software
- Desktop environment
- File extensions
- Window manager


### Types of desktop environment on Linux

* mate
* gnome
* KDE plasma
* XFCE
## Which Desktop environment is best?
- Animations
- High Graphics
- Quality
## why Linux?
- FAST
- No high spec computer/device needed
- Most used

- 47% of professional developers use Linux-based operating systems. 
    
- Linux powers 39.2% of websites whose operating system is known.
    
- Linux powers 85% of smartphones. (Hayden James)
    
- Linux, the third most popular desktop OS, has a market share of 2.09%.
    
- The Linux market size worldwide will reach $15.64 billion by 2027. 
    
- The world’s top 500 fastest supercomputers all run on Linux. 
    
- 96.3% of the top one million web servers are running Linux.
    
- Today, there are over 600 active Linux distros
    

- Most hacking tools
- Most Secured!
## Linux distributions/distros

- Distro is Modified Linux Kernels, type of operating systems with different:
- **So many distros…**

- Debian

- Kali Linux
- Ubuntu
- Parrot
- Arch
- Black arch
- Garde
- Fedora
- Red Hat
- Gentoo
- Android
## Which is best for hackers?

- Kali Linux
    
- Parrot Os
    
- Garuda
    
- Black Arch
    


### Do windows have distros?

- Windows is not open-source so peoples won’t use / edit it, so there won’t be other kind.

- It just give updates and adds some feature on it.

### How can we use it?

1. Main OS/ Main-boot
2. Dual Boot / 2in1
3. Live boot
4. Cloud terminals
5. Virtual Machine

- Computers have a Technology called “VIRTUALIZATION”. This is the method how it allocate our using memory to the virtual machines/ VM’s 
- This is a method to use windows and Linux together.
- Software's that gives you This ability:
- Hyber V
- QEMU
- Virtual Box - Oracle
- VMware
